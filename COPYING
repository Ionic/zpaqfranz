    This is zpaqfranz, a patched  but (maybe) compatible fork of ZPAQ version 7.15 
    (http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html)

    Portions of software by other authors, mentioned later, are included. 
    Different licenses apply to different "pieces".
    As far as I know this is allowed by the licenses. 
    Some text comment stripped due the size limit for github,
    but the various license-copyrights should be in place.

    I apologize if I have unintentionally violated any rule.
    Report it and I will fix as soon as possible.
